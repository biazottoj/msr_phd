It looks much much better (eg. `ui.components.logbook.for` is gone) but it still looks (based on the screenshots) that texts are concatenated together... It would be still difficult for translator to translate it in a way that make sense.

Something like this can be traslated more easier:

```
Light turned on
Triggered by automatition: Some automatition name
Triggered by state of: Some entity
```

Unfortunately, while it is easier to translate, splitting makes it look inconstant which means it would need a UX redesign which is outside the scope of this PR.   

Since this is an improvement over the last iteration, and it will make it easier to refactor into a multi-line setup later.  I suggest we merge this now and iterate on the UX design in the future.

issue_comment,GIT,ethereum/tests,https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/463,"I have sealed all the tests for networks <= Constantinople into LegacyTests  folder. Those tests are no longer need to be refilled. Only to execute (using retesteth -t LegacyTests)

A test must be refilled if the hash of a filler file is changed. That usually means that something in the postCondition section of the test has changed. New fork expectations added or some changes to the pre state. 

I would strictly not recommend to use any scripts to refill the tests as it is basically not needed for the clients that just want to check if they are passing the tests. To check if the client is passing the tests you could now use retesteth tool: https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth

If, however you create your own test, you would need to generate the test for your fork changes. For this automatition is not needed as you have to manually set the post condition and verify that your test (precondition -> transaction -> postCondition check) is passing everything correctly. read retesteth docs on how to write your own state test: https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth/wiki/Creating-a-State-Test-with-retesteth
